# PDF Export Content Rules

_CheckTax — Reference Downloads_

---

## Purpose of PDF Exports

PDF exports exist to help users:

- Save explanations for later reference
- Share summaries internally
- Understand the reforms offline

PDFs are **not official tax documents** and must never appear as such.

---

## What Can Be Exported

PDF exports may include:

- Tax reform explanations
- Applicable tax bands
- Exemptions and deductions summaries
- Compliance awareness checklists
- FAQ-style clarifications

All content must already exist within CheckTax documentation.

---

## What Must Not Be Exported

PDF exports must NOT include:

- Personalized tax advice
- Final tax calculations
- Filing instructions
- Government forms
- User-specific recommendations
- Legal opinions

No exceptions.

---

## Mandatory Disclaimer (Always Included)

Every exported PDF must include this text:

> This document is for informational purposes only.  
> It does not replace official guidance from the Nigeria Revenue Service.

The disclaimer must be visible, not hidden.

---

## Tone and Language Rules

PDF content must:

- Match the tone of the platform
- Use plain, citizen-friendly language
- Avoid legal or technical phrasing

This is a reference document, not a policy paper.

---

## Formatting Rules

- Clear section headings
- Short paragraphs
- Bullet points where appropriate
- No dense text blocks
- No charts that imply precision or authority

The document should feel readable on a phone.

---

## Scope Reminder

PDF exports must reflect:

- High-level explanations
- Indicative information only

They must never imply:

- Compliance completion
- Tax clearance
- Official endorsement

---

## Version Awareness

If possible, PDFs should include:

- Document title
- Reform year (2026)
- “As at” date or version marker

This helps users understand context over time.

---

## Final Rule

If content feels like it could be submitted to a government office, it does not belong in a PDF export.

PDFs explain.
Authorities decide.

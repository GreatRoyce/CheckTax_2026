# Tax Rules Logic – MVP

### Principles
- Rules are deterministic and predefined.
- No probabilistic or advisory outputs.
- All calculations are indicative.

### Covered Logic
- Personal income tax bands
- Income exemption up to ₦800,000
- Corporate turnover thresholds
- Asset exemptions:
  - Primary residence
  - Reinvested share profits
- Digital asset gains (high-level only)

---

### Exclusions
- Cross-border tax treaties
- Complex corporate structuring
- Enforcement logic
- Penalty computation

---

### Chat Logic
- Chat responses are mapped directly to tax rules.
- No interpretation, opinions, or recommendations.

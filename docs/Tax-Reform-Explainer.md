## What This Document Is
This document explains Nigeria’s 2026 tax reforms in plain language.  
It is written for everyday Nigerians, not tax professionals.

CheckTax uses **only the information in this document** to explain:
- What changed
- Who the changes affect
- What people should be aware of
- What actions may be required

This is **not legal advice**, tax filing software, or an official government notice.  
It is a clarity tool.

## Why the 2026 Tax Reforms Exist
Nigeria’s tax system has long been:
- Fragmented
- Duplicated
- Hard to understand
- Stressful even for compliant taxpayers

The 2026 reforms aim to:
- Remove duplicated taxes
- Simplify compliance
- Make taxation fairer
- Expand the tax base
- Digitize tax administration

This is a system-wide reset, not a minor adjustment.

---

## Who This Affects
The reforms apply differently depending on who you are.

This guide covers:
- Individual Nigerian taxpayers
- Salaried workers and professionals
- Small businesses and startups
- Large corporations
- Digital asset holders
- Property owners

Some groups benefit from exemptions. Others face new obligations.

## Key Changes at a Glance

### 1. Tax-Free Income Threshold
- Income up to **₦800,000 per year is tax-free**
- If you earn below this, you do not owe personal income tax

---

### 2. New Personal Income Tax Bands
Personal income is now taxed progressively, from:
- **0%** for the lowest income band
- Up to **25%** for the highest income band

The exact rate depends on how much you earn, not just that you earn.

---

### 3. Rent Relief
- Rent relief is set at **20%**
- Capped at **₦500,000 per year**
- Applies only where rent is eligible under the reform rules

---

### 4. Allowable Deductions
Certain contributions reduce taxable income, including:
- Pension contributions
- National Housing Fund
- Health insurance
- Life insurance
- Approved home loan interest

These deductions only apply if properly documented.

---

### 5. Small Business Exemptions
If a business has **annual turnover below ₦100 million**, it is:
- Exempt from Corporate Income Tax (CIT)
- Exempt from VAT
- Exempt from the development levy

This is a major simplification for small businesses.

---

### 6. Corporate Income Tax (Large Companies)
- Larger companies are subject to Corporate Income Tax
- A **minimum effective tax rate of 15%** applies
- Anti-profit shifting rules are enforced

This targets profit shifting and aggressive tax avoidance.

---

### 7. Consolidated Levy
Multiple smaller levies are replaced with a **single consolidated levy of 4%**, where applicable.

The goal is fewer payments, not more.

---

### 8. Digital Assets and Crypto
- Gains from digital assets may be taxable
- Applies to crypto and similar assets
- Taxability depends on realization and profit

Holding an asset is not the same as profiting from it.

---

### 9. Property Gains
- Gains from property sales may be taxable
- **Personal homes are exempt**
- Small personal items are excluded

---

## What Has Not Changed
Some things remain outside the tax net:
- Income below ₦800,000
- Personal homes
- Small personal items
- Reinvested share profits (under defined conditions)

Not everything is taxed. That matters.

---

When a question falls into this category, users should be directed to the official source.
